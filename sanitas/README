README

In an effort to keep my sanity I decided to write these scripts. 

Why? Because I want to keep all my repositories clean. Most of the times I need to
checkout different projects from different SCM to keep parallel versions installed
of the same application or library, keeping them syncronized and clean is a mess, 
you are spending too much time trying to see what repository you are using and 
the current parallel environment running, you spend too much time keeping that clean.

Sanitas (latin of Sanity) [proposed name, may change in the future]

Shell scripts in bin/:
- __sexport : must be defined as a function in bashrc
- __sdestroy: defined as function in __sexport
- __srestore: defined as function in __sexport

Ruby scripts in ./:
- sdetect : detects what repository is using current path
- screate : creates a new parallel environment
- slist : lists parallel environments
- sremove : removes parallel environment

INSTALL (this needs change)

export PATH="/path/sanitas:"$PATH
function sexport {
  source /path/sanitas/bin/__sexport $1
}
