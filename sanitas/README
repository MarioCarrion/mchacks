README

In an effort to keep my sanity I decided to write these scripts. 

Why? Because I want to keep all my repositories clean. Most of the time I need to
checkout different projects, and most of them are kept in different version control systems,
besides that I need to keep parallel versions installed of the same application or library, 
keeping everything syncronized and clean is a mess. You are spending too much time trying 
to see what repository you are using and the current parallel environment running, 
you spend too much time.

Sanitas (latin of Sanity) [proposed name, may change in the future]

Shell scripts in bin/:
- __sexport : must be defined as a function in bashrc

Ruby scripts in ./:
- sdetect : detects what repository is using current path
- screate : creates a new parallel environment
- slist : lists parallel environments
- sremove : removes parallel environment

INSTALL (this needs change)

export PATH="/path/sanitas:"$PATH
function sexport {
  source /path/sanitas/bin/__sexport $1
}
